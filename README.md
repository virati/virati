## Welcome!
I'm Vineet Tiruvadi, a Research Fellow at Harvard Medical School and Postdoctoral Scholar at Brigham and Women's Hospital.

I mostly work on "AI" at the intersection of Neuroscience, Medicine, and Control Theory.

## About Me
The most salient thing about me: I did an MD/PhD/MS at Emory/GeorgiaTech in Biomedical Engineering and Electrical and Computer Engineering.
I added in math research in the French Riviera, strategized with Congressman John Lewis, and sampled the AI Startup Space because it sounded fun.

### Research
I work mostly in Neuroengineering and MedTech, taking a *reverse engineering* approach that starts with clinical dynamics and decision-making *prima fascie*.

Specifically, I try to bring dynamical systems and control theory to *real world practice* - medical or otherwise - in order to both improve intervention and uncover understanding.
