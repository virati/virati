## Hi! I'm Vineet
I'm an MD/PhD student at Emory/GeorgiaTech in Atlanta. My research work focused on modeling how current deep brain stimulation works in treating psychiatric depression.
Moving forward I'll be focusing more on control theory and applying it a variety of problems, including those in patientcare.
