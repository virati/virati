## Welcome!

Welcome to my Github Space - there are a lot of repos here at various stages of actualization. That can be hard to navigate.

## About Me
I'm Vineet Tiruvadi, a Research Fellow at Harvard Medical School and Postdoctoral Scholar at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
Before that, I did an MD/PhD at Emory/GeorgiaTech in Biomedical Engineering and Electrical and Computer Engineering.

Somewhere in between I did math in the French Riviera, strategized with Congressman John Lewis, and sampled the AI Startup Space.

### Research
I work mostly in Neuroengineering and MedTech, taking a *reverse engineering* approach that starts with clinical dynamics and decision-making *prima fascie*.

Specifically, I try to bring dynamical systems and control theory to *real world practice* - medical or otherwise - in order to both improve intervention and uncover understanding.

For more information about my research interest, check out [my Research Vision](RESEARCH.md).
