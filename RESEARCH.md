# My Research Vision
*The Work... It never ends...*

I am, largely, a machine of academia.
To that end, I've always got a research vision at play.

Believe it or not, my research vision hasn't shifted much since 2013 - evolved and refined, sure, but not shifted.

## Broad Scope
My research interests are all comfortably in the domain of **Applied Control Theory**.

The main domain that I apply into is **Medicine**, particularly **Neuro**Medicine.
While this is very-likely to broaden in the near future, this is the domain I'll be outlining most in this document.

## Sub-Domains

### Antidepressant Deep Brain Stimulation


### Neural Dynamics


### Affect and Emotion//Dynamics


## Neuroglial Networks

One ancillary benefit of this domain is that is keeps my methods in the *multiplex* network space.

## Control Theoretic Frameworks in Medicine

## Legal and Policy Frameworks for Neuro/Med AI
